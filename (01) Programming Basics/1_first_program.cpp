#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout<<"Hello World"<<"\n"<<"Hello World"<<endl;
    return 0;
}


// Learnings:
// 1) "\n" same as endl but it is difficult to type so almost everyone uses endl.
// 2) Code for cout is written in the <iostream> fiel that we have included at the very top.
